# Metal in Swift

This repository is a collection of tutorials, examples, and playgrounds, documenting my pursuit to a basic understanding of the Metal framework.

Metal is low-level GPU framework for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS created in 2014 by Apple.

My reference for these is a text called "Metal programming guide: tutorial and refernce via Swift" by Janie Clayton.
